The main purpose of this lab activity is to get familiarized with the gas proportional chamber detector. For that a two gas chamber detectors were built 
from scratch using the simple components and relatively easy available parts. One of the detectors was built by using a piece of Al tube and the other by using a common beer can. 
For both detectors the spectrum of radioactive sources Fe-55 and Am-241 were measured.

\subsection{Building of the "PingaTube" detector}
\label{sec:building_pingatube}

\subsubsection{Materials for the PingaTube}
\label{sec:materials_pingatube}
In order to build the PingaTube detector the following parts were used:
\begin{itemize}
\item a cathod consisting in a aluminium tube (l = 146.5 mm, d$_{inner}$ = 20.63
  mm, d$_{outer}$ = 22.9 mm, d$_{window}$ = 9.2 mm)
\item an anode consisting in a Cu/Be wire (d = 0.025 mm)
\item two bras tubes to prevent gas multiplication at the end of the active
  volume (d = 1 mm, l$_{1}$ = 40.64 mm and l$_{1}$ = 42.72 mm)
\item insulating endcaps
\item P-10 gas Argon (90\%)/CH$_{4}$ (10\%)
\item gas tubes in order to convey the gas (d = 2.1 mm)
\item High voltage (HV) connector in order to supply high voltage to the anode
\item a ground cable in order to connect the cathode
\item O-ring wire connector
\item electric fastenning belt
\item Ultrasound bath with 10/90 Isopropanol/Water
\item Lab tools (Caliper (precition = 1/100 mm), Needle, Gloves, Files, Drill,
  Saw, Microscope, Oscilloscope, etc) and consumables (Soldering flux, aluminium
  tape, epoxy glue, etc)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Design and Assembly}
\label{sec:design_and_assembly_beercan}
The main target was to be able to design, build and use in a real data taking
experiment a proportional counter detector using every day objects. Most of the
materials were provided and hence creatively assembling the detector was the
main task. Due to safety regulations some steps, mostly cutting and drilling,
were handled by the instructors.

The bras tubes were sanded at the extremities to avoid sparks that could damage
the anode and, using a microscope, it was verified that no significant notches
were present. Any residue of grease on any of the internal parts could cause
dishomogeneities of the electric field and thus compromise the energy
resolution. In order to prevent this, all the parts were cleaned in an
ultrasonic bath of isopropanol/water mixture.

The thickness of the cathode tube was enough to stop the radiation from the
weaker source of Fe55 thus a small window, that was later covered with a thin
aluminum foil, was opened approximately in the middle of it.

The Cu/Be wire was soldered to the HV connector and glued to the end caps. In
order to fix and seal the chamber the end caps were glued with a two component
epoxy glue.  The Cu/Be wire was inserted thru two brass tubes in both the
extremes of the chamber in order to ensure as uniform field as possible.  A
window in a form of circular hole was drilled around the middle part of the
chamber. The end caps have holes to provide access for gas tubes, they were
glued in both sides with the epoxy glue.  The Cu/Be wire and the pipe were
connected and soldered the high voltage connector as anode and ground
respectively. A part of the aluminum tube was polished to create space for
grounding and that surface was covered with copper tape for providing better
contact.  Given that the Cu/Be is toxic gloves were required for handling it.
Additionally the wire easily bends increasing the risk of it being break. The
wire was soldered to the extremes of the brass tubes already mounted in the end
caps. All was sealed with the epoxy glue afterwards.

After the assembly process the P10 gas was flushed into the detector in order to
extract as much O$_2$ as possible. The main reason of this is O$_2$ is a
quenching gas that absorbs the avalanche electrons.  Presence of leakages of gas
from the detector tube was checked with a flowmeter. Volume of the aluminum
tube: \emph{Volume of the tube}, Volume of the tube
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:tube_volume}
  V=\frac{\pi L^2}{4} =14.65*3.14*2.06324*2.06324=48,96 cm^3
\end{equation}
With a flow 10 ml/min = 600 cm$^3$/h content of the volume changes ~10 times per
hour. The variation of O$_{2}$ concentration with time is shown on Fig.  Units
of x-axis are ppm = 1,000,000 m$_{c}$ / m$_{s}$, where m$_{c}$ = mass of
component (argon/methane mix, kg) m$_{s}$ = mass of solution (oxygen, kg).  Some
failures which were fixed were:
\begin{itemize}
\item one of the gas tubes did were not interted properly which caused gas
  leaking, The problem was sucessfuly fixed afterwards by removing and
  reinserting it properly.  This caused a lot of delay due to the time that the
  glue delays on drying besides the fact that it was needed to reflux the gas on
  the detector.
\item There were some gas leakages that were sorted out propperly by glue
  sealing the positions in which the floweter detector establish the gas
  leakages.
\item One of the brass tubes went loose inside of the aluminium tube. The issue
  was sorted out on time before the glu dried without any further problem.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Building of the "BeerCan" detector}
\label{sec:building_beercan}

\subsubsection{Materials for the BeerCan}
\label{sec:materials_beercan}
In order to build the "BeerCan" detector the following parts were used:
\begin{itemize}
\item a catode consisting in a beer can (l = 146.5 mm, d$_{inner}$ = 64.0 mm,
  d$_{thickness}$ = 0.2 mm)
\item an anode consisting in a Cu/Be wire as the anode (d = 0.075 mm)
\item two brass tubes. (d = 1 mm, l$_{1}$ = 40.64 mm and l$_{1}$ = 42.72 mm)
\item guide in order to protect the brass tubes of touching the can (d = 3.21
  mm)
\item bushing
\item plastic endcaps
\item gas tubes in order to flux the gas (d = 2.1 mm)
\item HV connector in order to supply high voltage to the anode
\item a ground cable in order to connect the cathode.
\item P10 gas Argon (90\%)/CH$_{4}$ (10\%)
\item Ultrasound bath with 10/90 Isopropanol/Water
\item Lab tools (Caliper (precition = 1/100 mm), Needle, Gloves, Files, Drill,
  Saw, Microscope, Oscilloscope, etc) and consumables (Soldering flux, aluminium
  tape, epoxy glue, etc)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Design and Assembly of the BeerCan}
\label{sec:design_and_assembly_beercan}
The design was intended for using a beer can as gas chamber detector. The
building and assembly was very similar to the description on the PingaTube
detector with the mechanical differences imposed by the beer can geometry.
Again most of the materials were provided and hence creatively assembling the
detector was the main task. After the assembly process the P10 gas was flushed
into the detector and the flowmeter was used for detecting gas leakages.  Some
differences in the assembly of the BeerCan detector compared to the PingaTube
detector were:
\begin{itemize}
\item Necesity of scratching inner and outer surfaces of the beer can so the
  nonconductive cover was removed.
\item Use of 0.075 mm brass tubes for easier manipulation and insertion of the
  Cu/Be wire.
\end{itemize}
The brass tubes had a diameter of 5.5 mm. The length was chosen so that their
end is at a distance of 3 cm from the center of the can. Further, the diameter
of the gas tubes was 2.86 mm and the length of banana plug was 67 mm.
Volume of the beercan tube: \emph{Volume of the tube}, Volume of the tube
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:tube_volume}
  V=\frac{\pi L^2}{4} =14.65*3.14*6.40*6.40=471,05 cm^3
\end{equation}
With a flow 10 ml/min = 600 cm$^3$/h content of the volume changes ~10 times per
hour. The variation of O$_{2}$ concentration with time is shown on Fig. Units of
x-axis are ppm = 1,000,000 m$_{c}$ / m$_{s}$, where m$_{c}$ = mass of component
(argon/methane mix, kg) m$_{s}$ = mass of solution (oxygen, kg)

Some failures:
\begin{itemize}
\item There was gas leaking in the endcaps, they were sealed by using the epoxy
  gum and covering all the leaking points detected.
\item The Cu/Be wire got blended and a little bit loose while trying to solder
  it to the one of the brass tubes which might have cause the detector to have
  an extremely poor signal hence it was considered a failure. There was not
  enough time for fixing this issue since it practically would have taken the
  dissasembly of the whole detector.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Measurement apparatus}
\label{sec:meas-appar}
Figure~\ref{fig:exp_setup} shows a schematic view of the setup used for the
calibration of the detector and data taking. The signal from the detector at
first pass trough a pre-amplifier, this has a capacitance of 1~pF and is
connected to a high voltage power supply (HVPS) so that the input voltage is
directly proportional to the charge generated in the detector through the well
know formula\autocite{Knoll:RadMeasurement}
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:capacitance}
  Q = CV.
\end{equation}
The pre-amplifier is then connected to a spectrum amplifier with adjustable gain
and a pulse generator. From the spectrum amplifier the signal was sent to an
oscilloscope for online monitoring and adjustments and to a multi-channel
analyzer (MCA) that was connected to a computer to record the data.

  \label{fig:exp_setup}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Calibration}
\label{sec:calibration}
In order to calibrate the detector the pulse generator was used to injected in
the pre-amplifier a known pulse. The oscilloscope was used to read the pulse
voltage that multiplied by the pre-amplifier capacitance gives the collected
charge as described in Section~\ref{sec:meas-appar}. The distribution on the MCA
was fitted with a Gaussian using the data taking software, the mean value is
then associated to a charge and the standard deviation used as uncertainty. This
procedure was performed for a set of input voltages and, due to time
restrictions, only for a gain value of 100. Figure~\ref{fig:calibration_fit}
shows the calculated collected charge as a function of the MCA channel number
with a linear fit superimposed. Figure~\ref{fig:calibration_raw} shows the
counts as a function of the MCA channel number.
